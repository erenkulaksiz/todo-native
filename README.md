# todonative

<br/>

### NOTE: This app uses Mockapi to use API functionality. My todo-react repo uses same API! If you want custom api, you can change from ./modules/classes/api.js

### I made this CRUD TO-DO app with React Native to practice my skills. Tried to use Redux but that became a bit unsuccessful, ill try to use it next time.
